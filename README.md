To whom it may concern,

I worked hard on buiding this, so I hope it looks ok.  Please remember, I am only a beginner.  I have a long way to go, but this was a great place to start with HTML and CSS.
I am not sure what the two "JekSet theme jekyll-theme-time-machine" are, but I cannot figure out how to delete them but I wanted to turn in my page.  There are the HTML pages; index,
about me, and contact; along with 3 css pages.  Thank you.
